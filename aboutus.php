It offers wilderness saltwater fishing from complete comfort in luxury accommodations on the Caribbean Coast near the border with Belize. It looks out over the sea and its part of the second longest barrier reef in the world. It is small catering to only 6 anglers at one time, with 4 rooms to provide space for non anglers as well as anglers. The whole idea behind the rebuild was to make individual attention the first priority of the lodge and staff. The meals are served taking advantage of the chef's expertise in preparing Mexican and international cuisine. All of the drinks are on the house and the bar is always open. It is located where it is on purpose. It was originally built by Dial Duncan about 20 years ago and he chose its foundation to be laid </span>
